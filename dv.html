				<p class="subheading">_1. Summary </p>
				<p>
					We found few instances of actionable political information being shared in the weeks leading
					to the 2020 Presidential Election, demonstrating a high probability of data voids
					in public Facebook communities for Latinx-Americans. While there was some information on
					political themes like immigration or healthcare, there wasn't really
					any meaningful discussion taking place. While we can't measure the impact of the
					political information vacuum, the critical takeaway is a politically neutral avenue is unused
					in the disemination of complex knowledge for a politically-underepresented community.

			<div class="info">
				<p class="subheading">_2. What Are Data Voids</p>
				<p>
					Data Voids as coined by Golebiewski and Boyd are queries where lack of information available causes
					disproportionately higher overrepresentation of relevant but unreliable sources. Let's look at the
				  term query "election". Please note that this is just an fictitious diagram to better illustrate my point and current searches are very different
					from the graphics shown. *hover mouse over graphics <br><br>
					<div id="wdv1"></div> <br>
					Results come from a wide variety of sources with various perspectives on the term. While there is one
					potentially harmful result the rest of the sources can easily drown it out.<br>
					<div id="wdv2"></div> <br>
					As the query changes to "Election Fraud", less results are availble some could be disproving it others
					are encouraging of the rumor. The weight of the fictitious and harmful results are increased. Another caveat of
					data voids, the earlier the user looks for the term a greater proportion of harmful results appear as less resources are
					availble to fact check the claim.<br><br>
					<div id="wdv3"></div><br>
					If the query is a question "how did election fraud occur", there's an extremely high chance that all the results would
					be confirming the rumor despite the authoritativeness of the results themselves. The most closely aligned search results, those with
					the highest phrase correlation due to search engine optimization, would be results questioning the validity of the election. Less results are
					available and the fictitious claims that are there instead are magnified to fill the space.<br><br>

				<p class ="subheading">_3. Social Media Data Voids</p>
				<p>
					We've transitioned this idea of data voids into the use of social media. This method of data retrieval has two core differences. First,
					the user is now passively absorbing information as opposed to actively looking and identifying through a search engine. Second,
					information is being shared via peer-2-peer messaging and not recommended by an algorithm. <br><br>

					Now data voids are no longer about the type of query in use, but a combination of interal knowledge and digital relationships. Let's look at
					the following story.<br><br>

					Let's assume you are not a doctor.

					<div id="fakepost"></div><br>

					Bryan posts on his feed that your heart is powered by two men on tandem bicycle. OF course
					that's wrong, you know a heart has blood and oxygen and stuff that makes it do its thing. Nowhere
					in the body are there two men riding a bicycle powering the heart. This isn't Osmosis Jones!
