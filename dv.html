				<p class="subheading">_1. Summary </p>
				<p>
					We found few instances of actionable political information being shared in the weeks leading
					to the 2020 Presidential Election, demonstrating a high probability of data voids
					in public Facebook communities for Latinx-Americans. While there was some information on
					political themes like immigration or healthcare, there wasn't really
					any meaningful discussion taking place. While we can't measure the impact of the
					political information vacuum, the critical takeaway is a politically neutral avenue is unused
					in the disemination of complex knowledge for a politically-underepresented community.

				<p class="subheading">_2. What Are Data Voids</p>
				<p>
					Data Voids as coined by Golebiewski and Boyd are queries where lack of information available causes
					disproportionately higher overrepresentation of relevant but unreliable sources. Let's look at the
				  term query "election". Please note that this is just an fictitious diagram to better illustrate my point and current searches are very different
					from the graphics shown. *hover mouse over graphics <br><br>
					<div id="wdv1"></div> <br>
					Results come from a wide variety of sources with various perspectives on the term. While there is one
					potentially harmful result the rest of the sources can easily drown it out.<br>
					<div id="wdv2"></div> <br>
					As the query changes to "Election Fraud", less results are availble some could be disproving it others
					are encouraging of the rumor. The weight of the fictitious and harmful results are increased. Another caveat of
					data voids, the earlier the user looks for the term a greater proportion of harmful results appear as less resources are
					availble to fact check the claim.<br><br>
					<div id="wdv3"></div><br>
					If the query is a question "how did election fraud occur", there's an extremely high chance that all the results would
					be confirming the rumor despite the authoritativeness of the results themselves. The most closely aligned search results, those with
					the highest phrase correlation due to search engine optimization, would be results questioning the validity of the election. Less results are
					available and the fictitious claims that are there instead are magnified to fill the space.<br><br>

				</p>

			<div class="info">
				<p class ="subheading">_3. Social Media Data Voids</p>
				<p>
					We've transitioned this idea of data voids into the use of social media. This method of data retrieval has two core differences. First,
					the user is now passively absorbing information as opposed to actively looking and identifying through a search engine. Second,
					information is being shared via peer-2-peer messaging and not recommended by an algorithm. <br><br>

					Now data voids are no longer about the type of query in use, but a combination of interal knowledge and digital relationships. Let's look at
					the following story.<br><br>

					Let's assume you are not a doctor.

					<div id="fakerpost"></div><br>

					Bryan posts on his feed that your heart is powered by two men on tandem bicycle. Of course
					that's wrong, you know a heart has blood and oxygen and stuff that makes it do its thing. Nowhere
					in the body are there two men riding a bicycle powering the heart.<br><br>

					<div id="fakepost"></div><br>

					But if we change it to a more subtle rumor this one by Calvin who shares
					a news article on how deoderant can cause cancer. I personally think it's somewhat believable in my
					opinion. I don't know anything about the materials in deoderant nor do I know anything about cancer causes.
					My lack of background in either field makes me more likely to believe in this rumor. <br><br>

					The dangerous part about social media data voids is how acceptance is a key part of learning information.
					Depending on your own motivation to interact with this information and whether you initially disagree
					with the statement, you could be compelled to go out of you way to Google Ave. and find out that what Calvin is
					sharing is wrong. But who has the time to fact check every single statement they encounter online? Isn't it easier to
					just accept it? <br><br>

					This flow is the Process of Explanation by Krull & Anderson. There's a trigger (post)
					that makes you aware of somehting like an event, activity, or function. Then you incorporate more
					informationto understand why its happening (rest of the post, comments, internalized knowledge,
					other sources). If you're happy with it or lack any other resources to investigate furhter, you stop and accept the
					explanation that deoderants can cause cancer. <br><br>

					So when acceptance is key to learning, that makes echo chambers and groupthink collectives
					extremeley vulnerable to misinformation theories. Prior research has abetted this statement,
					when encountering viewpoints that aid in their beliefs, participants tend not to challenge or
					investigate further. <br><br>

					This story is about internalized knowledge and how people react to new information. But data voids
					can also involve filter bubbles that restrict new perspectives from being
					shared into communities. Political groups can manufacture data
					voids by dissuading facts that do not contribute to a dominating narrative.

				<p class="subheading">_4. Latinx Political Representation</p>
				<p>So why did we choose Latinx as our case study population? <br><br>

				We had a mixture of reasons: <br>
					&#9675;Minority groups are often ignored in media unless supporting stereotypes.<br>
					&#9675;Latinx-immmigration was a prominent subject of interest during the 2016 election.<br>
					&#9675;The Latinx population is one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States<br>
					&#9675;Prior cultural knowledge from my collaborators.<br>
					&#9675;Latinx populations have been previously targeted from misinformation.<br>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="info">
				<p class="subheading">_5. Methodology<p>
				<p>
				We used a list from the pew research center to define the main politicla themes of interest
				to the Latinx population. These themes were: <br><br>
				&#9675; Abortion <br>
				&#9675; Climate Change <br>
				&#9675; Covid <br>
				&#9675; Crime <br>
				&#9675; Economy & Economic Inequality <br>
				&#9675; Gun Control <br>
				&#9675; Immigration <br>
				&#9675; Supreme Court <br>
				&#9675; Healthcare <br>
				&#9675; Foreign Policy<br>
				&#9675; Racism <br><br>


				From there we created a list of terms in English and translated into Spanish
				that could correlate as discussion of that political discourse. Posts found mentioning the border,
				naturalization, or I.C.E. could be inferred as immigration-related. Taxes, jobs, or unemployment
				on the other hand was a sample of the terms used as indicators of the economy.  <br><br>

				Because data voids are vacuums the only way we could suggest their existence in the social media community
				is by comparing the frequency of discussion. For the purpose of this study
				we defined three contexts which could influence the sharing of political information; news media,
				political, and community. Inclusion criteria for the Facebook groups and pages used in
				this study needed explicit reference to the Latinx community and be a public page or group. Additional
				requirements for the finding and organization of each Facebook community was context specific. <br><br>

				&#9675;News media: Facebook page of Latino-oriented outlets as described by the Latino Media Report. <br>
				&#9675;Social: Explicit reference of Latinx cultural group (Hispanic, Cuban, Latino) and American identifier
				(California, Santa Barbara, D.C.)<br>
				&#9675;Political: If the American identifier is political reference (Republican, Conservative, Democratic)<br><br>

				After identifying the communities for this studied we queried our list of terms into Crowdtangle, a Facebook owned social-media scraping tool,
				to save each post from August 18, 2020 (Joe Biden's Democratic nomination) until November 3rd, 2020 (Election day). Every post is collected and saved under
				its respective political theme. Please note that each theme is not exclusive, therefore posts can be archived under multiple themes. Once we had our data,
				we generated a null hypothesis to guide our analysis process.

				<br><br>

				<span>H(0): Latinx political Facebook communities have no impact on frequency of political-topic conversations.</span><br><br>

				To disprove our null hypothesis, we had to perform a statistical analysis on our thematic discourse. We counted the frequency of posts for each political theme across
				all pages and groups separately. We then conducted a Levene test due towards our difference in sample sizes to see if our samples demonstrated equal variance. If the Levene test was
				statistically insignifcant, we would use a regular ANOVA otherwise a Welsh ANOVA would be used instead. Statistical signifance with either ANOVA would show that
				the observed frequency of the political themes were impacted by the group context and political groups do have an impact on frequency of conversation.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="info">
				<p class="subheading">_6. Findings</p>
				<p> The number of Facebook communities mentioning at least one political theme differed by context.<br><br>
						&#9675;Social : 611 Unique Communities<br>
						&#9675;Political: 160 Unique Communities<br>
						&#9675;News: 402 Unique Communities<br><br>

				Between the 1000+ different communities, there were about 250,000  posts shared mentioning one political topic.
				<br><br>As mentioned before we averaged these posts per group.
				<img src="images/avg.png"></img>
				<br><br>And then we conducted a statistical analysis.
				<img src="images/anova.jpg"></img>
				<br><br>Foreign policy was the only theme to not show any statistical difference (p < 0.05). So for most themes,
				a person's political exposure is heavily dependent on which groups they are apart of. If we look at the following
				visualization we can see the primary focus of each category. COVID and healthcare (likely related) have the
				highest social media coverage.
				<img src = "images/allgraphs.png"></img>
				<br><br>There is a distinction between whether or not data voids were formed
				after a news event. Short-tail data voids are created when there is a need
				for information to events like crises, pandemics, or other
				breaking news. They are called "short-tail" because of an understanding that
				more information is needed and ambiguities or room for rummors will be satisfied over
				time. Long-tail data voids are gaps of information that have no such consideration. Instead
				the lack of coverage persists and allows for the proliferation of rumors or misinformation instead.
				It's important to note that previous research on
				information-sharing has found that behaviors change drastically the moment topics shift
				from news to actionable, political content.
				<br><br>
				<img src= "images/wocovid.png"></img><br>
				If we accomodate for Covid-related noise, then we can see that the number of posts per theme by
				news and social communities appear much more similar. Political groups seem to be under-discuss most topics
				mainly due to the smaller sample size.
				<br><br>
				Talk about the average -> distribution of averages
