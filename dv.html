      <p>SHORTAGES IN THE INFORMATION ECONOMY</p>

				<p class="subheading">_1. Summary </p>
				<p>
					We found few instances of actionable political information being shared in the weeks leading
					to the 2020 Presidential Election, demonstrating a high probability of data voids
					in public Facebook communities for Latinx-Americans. While there was some information on
					political themes like immigration or health, there wasn't really
					any meaningful discussion surrounding either group. While we can't measure the impact of the
					political information vacuum, the critical takeaway is a politically neutral avenue is unused
					in the disemination of complex knowledge for an underepresented community.

				<p class="subheading">_2. What Are Data Voids</p>
				<p>
					Data Voids as coined by Golebiewski and Boyd are queries where lack of information available causes
					disproportionately higher overrepresentation of relevant but unreliable sources. Let's look at the politically
					fun term query "election fraud".

			<p>What if thereâ€™s a high demand and very little supply in the information economy?
				Data voids as coined by Golebiewski and Boyd (2019),
				are pockets on the internet where very little information
				available causes disproportionately high overrepresentation of
				relevant but unreliable sources. While data voids themselves are
				not inherently problematic, the lack of competing information magnifies
				any content that enters; opening potential for misinformation, conspiracy
				indoctrination, and manipulation. This research project investigates the presence of
				potential data voids surrounding United States, political topics within the
				Latinx-oriented Facebook communities.<br><br>

				Data voids that have been explicitly researched are short tail, meaning that
				a lack of information is already acknowledged and more information will be produced
				to clear up most confusion surrounding that topic. Alternatively, this research investigates
				long tail data voids, where a lack of information persists, and when unaddressed,
				exacerbates particular ideologies.<br><br>

				Data incorporated for this study comes from Crowdtangle, a public insights
				tool owned and operated by Facebook. Facebook groups and pages are identified
				if they are A) Facebook pages of Latinx-oriented news media outlets described by the
				Latino News Media Research group at City University of New York or B) Have
				explicit Latinx (Peruvian, Cuban, Hispanic) and United States (New York, Biden, Democrat)
				identfiers in the title. All groups and pages are public.

				<p>Posts are collected from all identified Latinx-groups within the time frame of August
				18, 2020 (Joe Biden's Democratic Nomination) until the election on November 3rd, 2020. </p>

				<p>Posts are then faceted into three groups depending on group and page name:<br>	&#9608; Geo-Cultural:if the United
					States identifier lacks political terminology<br>	&#9608; Political: if the United States
					identifier is political<br>	&#9608; News: if the page is associated with a Latino
					news outlet.</p>

				<p>We use proxy terminology as indication of interest in a political subject. These words were developed from Wikipedia pages on
					the United States policy for each political topic. Furthermore these words do not measure
					political intent or political stance. </p>

				<p>This research is based on two assumptions that
					1_ Aggregate Latino Facebook communities have the same target audience and so they're community makeup should be similar even despite
					political polarization within political communities
					2_ Topic mentions correlate with visibility. Based on Krull and Anderson's explanation model where topic conversations
					within these public groups can be used to make viewers aware of possible situations. The same thinking
					is used by Dubois et al. where topic awareness is used for stimulating viewers about a topic and echo chambers
					are argued to exist without this topic awareness. </p>

				<p>Stay tuned for data visualizations about the findings!</p>
