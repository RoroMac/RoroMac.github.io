				<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "introback">
				<p>The prompt for the class was to find a topic we are passionate about which
					relates to the broad scope of health. We chose to pair environmentally
					conscious efforts with digital activism in the exigence of COVID-19 which
					has forcibly moved a number of activist movements to online platforms.

				<p>We wanted to explore how to make change more accessible for
					all users. We held initial biases that current digital, environmental
					activism teetered on either sides of an extreme gradient; shallow
					(clicktivism) to demanding a high degree of political participation which often has monetary,
					time-based, and social constraints. We spent ten weeks following the human-centered methodology
					taught in HCDE 518, which led us through preliminary research, interviews, personas,
					sketching and ideation, prototyping, and gathering-feedback.</p>

				<p>Our prototype can be accessed through the following image and
					the submitted and the comprehensive design solution can be found through
					this <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J843YeTDLpgoRCv_s8VQwkB1NJv_XRPh/view?usp=sharing"> google drive hyperlink (40 pages)</a>.

			<div id="presearch">
				<p class = "title"> PRE-RESEARCH</p>

				<div id="showcase">

					<p id="presearchstxt">Preliminary research consisted of using IDEO’s design exploration cards;
						Learn, Look, Ask, and Try to identify current barriers to waste disposal
						and understand what alternatives are available for people to use.</p>

						<p class="subsub">Five Why's</p>

						<p>Methodology &colon; <br>
						An informal interview process taken place with a friend over a
						thirty minute period. After the initial "Do you recycle" question,
						every answer was responded with a "why?".
						</p>

						<p>Findings &colon; <br>
							1. Doesn't produce that much waste. <br>
							2. Small home-scale recycling efforts don't help <br>
							3. Not comparable to the amount of waste produced by large companies <br>
							4. Difficult to find adequate support for recycling. <br>
							5. There should be greater incentive and ease to use the recycling system.
						</p>

					<p class="subsub"> Affinity Diagram</p>

					<p>Methodology &colon; <br>
					Draw a map of the relationships at interplay surrounding the topic.
					While this method can reinforce personal biases, it makes the participant
					aware of what they currently know, what information is missing, and the
					regions  available for intervention. The associations started as broad groupings and then
					divulged into more hypserspecific and useful suggestions.</p>

					<p>Findings &colon; <br>
					1. Waste disposal aids, commonly known at festivals or other
					public gatherings, help people better dispose of garbage by
					directing waste to the correct bin. They have a key social aspect
					and spark conversations for attracting other people to their organization.
					However their presence could also have a social limitation such as
					embarrassment or humiliation for not knowing a perceived simple task.<br> <br>
					2. Appropriate social groups are commonly used for incorporating activity.
					Social relationships like family or friends can be used to gamify
					activities, share information, and encourage persistent action.
					These relationships are also especially critical because of the
					physicality of waste disposal as opposed to shallow clicktivism.<br> <br>
					3. The institutional  level of recycling is not very well known and
					easy to understand. I personally knew very little about the
					iconography commonly associated and attempted to explore ideas
					to make them more comprehensive. <br> <br>
					4. The last grouping highlighted differences
					in waste processes according to the function. Is
					there a standardized way of generating and disposing
					waste? How could similarities as well as sensitivities
					attributed to concepts of cooking, arts and crafts, and
					 cleaning be levied in a new system. An understanding was
					 developed that waste is a byproduct and end result of each process.
					 However, in order to address unsustainability, recommendations
					 should be heard at the beginning of the process.

			<p class="title">INTERVIEWS</p>
			<div class="right">
				<p>Methodology:<br>
					The two interviews that I conducted were all
					greater than an hour and because of the open-ended
					design question we had no specific demographic in mind.
					Because of the difficulties of talking to strangers during this time,
					my interviewees were both acquaintances that I knew prior. This sample
					size could have skewed results as they shared common characteristics of
					being similar in age, sharing the same gender, and having common cultural
					backgrounds. However, due to the distinct differences in discussed topics
					and their perceived behavioral patterns I would believe the potential change
					to be inconsequential.<br><br>

					The interview structure was a combination of scripted and
					unscripted questions. The questions discussed general lifestyle habits,
					such as what digital applications they currently used or what they look
					for while shopping. The interview would then progress into more topic-focused
					questions like the ease or stories associated with waste disposal processes.
					Because I wanted to see if they naturally considered waste in their daily
					rituals, I tried to give them as vague of an introduction as possible.<br><br>

					Findings:<br>
					- Typically don’t go searching for the information,
					but once they learn something highly relevant like a
					toxic warning or company-ethics, they’ll usually attempt to go
					with more inconvenient but sustainable option<br><br>
					- One story talked about how they kept reusing a plastic
					water bottle even at parties to impress their friends <br><br>
					- Both interviewees felt that waste conversations are highly
					dependent on the local community and one noted how waste seems
					to only be a relevant conversation the younger you are.<br><br>
					- Endorsements and appearance of officiality are important to
					help make information reliable especially when there are so many
					different variations of information on the same subject. <br><br>
					- One discussed the perceived physicality of information,
					having discussions and tangible mechanisms make it harder for
					the topic of waste management to be ignored. <br><br>

				<p class="title">USER FLOW</p>
				<div class="right">
				<p>Along with the interviews, I created a flow chart to
					depict the actions of users to visualize the possible areas for
					digital intervention. This flowchart took my idea of different processes
					for generating waste and attempted to find shared traits regardless of
					activity; like cooking, gardening, arts and crafts, or DIY repairs. The
					final result, this flowchart of making things, breaks up the process
					as shopping(getting materials), making (some function performed with
					the materials), and disposing.</p>

					<p class="subsub">Purchasing</p>
					<p>Purchasing was inspired by my interview of people’s shopping
					experiences. Again with quarantine due to COVID, we were unable to
					naturally observe them performing these activities. A flowchart
					was especially helpful in visualizing how people make decisions and
					choosing what to purchase. Questions of consideration are not the same
					between individuals, but are personal reflections that ultimately
					decide whether or not to purchase the item. Common questions revolved
					around price, company ethics, and personal health.</p>

					<p class="subsub">Using</p>
					<p>Using, is the primary function that I believe most users focus on.
					They take a base material and perform some kind of action on it like
					cutting, mixing, or moving. Once the action is completed, then they enter
					another state of consideration like before. Reflection comes in questions
					of quality and completion, either prompting users to throw away or continue
					adjusting the object until completed. </p>

					<p class="subsub">Disposing</p>
					<p>Lastly, disposing is the final section in waste management.
					The flow chart raises awareness of multiple sections of consideration
					involving time, effort, and personal beliefs. Lack of institutional
					support like waste bins or personal beliefs on the impact of their efforts
					are very important determinants of whether an item is going in the trash or
					effectively recycled. It’s important to note that these beliefs were supported
					by both interviews. One noted the inconvenience of composting in their apartment
					as the bin often gets filled up quickly and the bag tended to leak down his leg
					while throwing it away. The second interviewee mentioned that it was an
					unreasonable expectation to walk several blocks for the chance to recycle
					when there’s a trashcan right next to them.</p>

					<p class="subsub">So Why?<p>
					<p>Waste management is not an end-process consideration. It’s important to
					layout the entire, holistic process to identify possible ways to influence
					people for more environmentally-conscious behavior. In the shopping
					mechanism how can we make information for purchasing decisions more
					accessible with the minimum required steps. In making, are there
					certain methods that can be done to reduce the byproducts or support
					the longevity of creations. And most importantly how can we get people
					to care about their impact when disposing, especially when it may be
					perceived as inconvenient.</p>

			Assistance | Social Accountability</p></div>

			<div id="design">
				<p class="title">KEY THEMES</p>
				<div class="right">
					<p>After establishing points of intervention and talking to users
				we narrowed our product to emphasize three main themes for gaining
				and retaining environmentally-friendly habits.<p>

					<p class="subsub">Personal Accountability</p>
					<p>Personal accountability is manifested in the My Rici,
						 homepage of the application. Its features help maintain
						  personal goals through challenges, journaling, and
							rewarding users with graphs related to their recycling efforts.
							The challenges are meant to gamify the process of eco-friendly
							lifestyles and can help families or friends work to achieve
							common goals or compete against each other. The gamified process
							enables users to gain a hobbyist perspective on environmental
							conservation. They can learn about the environmental-friendly
							efforts while at their own pace. The journaling feature is based
							on an interviewee’s perspective on how to make the conversation
							surrounding sustainability more tangible. By providing a mechanism
							for personal reflection, then there is a chance that more users will
							be able to change their mindset. The last feature of My Rici, is the
							data visualization on the front page to show that their efforts are
							actually impactful. By providing graphs about their activity over time,
							users can get the feeling that they are making an impact.</p>

					<p class="subsub">Technical Help</p>
					<p>Technical help describes inconveniences that can only be satisfied
						through an outside source. The Analyze feature aims to answer
						confusion regarding recyclability, sustainability, and reusability
						of products. Users scan the product in question with their smartphone
						camera and using computer vision, the application identifies what it
						is. Based on the product, it then produces relevant information on the
						best or alternative ways to dispose of the product. We believe that this
						feature is a critical component of our application so we wanted it to be
						easy to find and accessible regardless of where they are in the app. This
						approach enables users to access the Analyze feature without forcing them to
						engage with potentially unwanted features.
					</p>

					<p class="subsub">Social Accountability</p>
					<p>Because we can only do so much by ourselves, the Community tab is
						for engaging with our neighbors. It advertises events such as workshops,
						lectures, or volunteer opportunities. Local forum posts are used for
						soliciting advice, engaging in dialogue, or spreading awareness about
						regional topics. By having a platform for community-based discussions,
						it allows for more accurate information to be shared and another mechanism
						to interact with your community. Posts are anonymous, with the exception of a
						select few, to help circumvent possible embarrassment when asking for help.
						While a friend feature is also utilized in the application, the philosophy is
						less about trying to become a social butterfly, but rather sharing your
						accomplishments with those who mean a lot to you. Friends can see events
						that you are going to, community posts, and awards that you’ve recently
						received. By seeing other people engage in environmentally friendly ways,
						having easy access to accurate information, and better awareness of events
						to help in your community, users can have more assurance in retaining
						sustainable habits.
