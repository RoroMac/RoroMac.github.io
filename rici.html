				<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "introback">
				<p>The prompt for the class was to find a topic we are passionate about which
					relates to the broad scope of health. We chose to pair environmentally
					conscious efforts with digital activism in the exigence of COVID-19 which
					has forcibly moved a number of activist movements to online platforms.

				<p>We wanted to explore how to make change more accessible for
					all users. We held initial biases that current digital, environmental
					activism teetered on either sides of an extreme gradient; shallow
					(clicktivism) to demanding a high degree of political participation which often has monetary,
					time-based, and social constraints. We spent ten weeks following the human-centered methodology
					taught in HCDE 518, which led us through preliminary research, interviews, personas,
					sketching and ideation, prototyping, and gathering-feedback.</p>

				<p>Our prototype can be accessed through the following image and
					the submitted and the comprehensive design solution can be found through
					this <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J843YeTDLpgoRCv_s8VQwkB1NJv_XRPh/view?usp=sharing"> google drive hyperlink (40 pages)</a>.

			<div id="presearch">
				<p class = "title"> Preliminary research</p>

				<div id="showcase">

					<p id="presearchstxt">Preliminary research consisted of using IDEOâ€™s design exploration cards;
						Learn, Look, Ask, and Try to identify current barriers to waste disposal
						and understand what alternatives are available for people to use.</p>

						<p class="subsub">Five Why's</p>

						<p>Methodology &colon; <br>
						An informal interview process taken place with a friend over a
						thirty minute period. After the initial "Do you recycle" question,
						every answer was responded with a "why?".
						</p>

						<p>Findings &colon; <br>
							1. Doesn't produce that much waste. <br>
							2. Small home-scale recycling efforts don't help <br>
							3. Not comparable to the amount of waste produced by large companies <br>
							4. Difficult to find adequate support for recycling. <br>
							5. There should be greater incentive and ease to use the recycling system.
						</p>

					<p class="subsub"> Affinity Diagram</p>

					<p>Methodology &colon; <br>
					Draw a map of the relationships at interplay surrounding the topic.
					While this method can reinforce personal biases, it makes the participant
					aware of what they currently know, what information is missing, and the
					regions  available for intervention. The associations started as broad groupings and then
					divulged into more hypserspecific and useful suggestions.</p>

					<p>Findings &colon; <br>
					1. Waste disposal aids, commonly known at festivals or other
					public gatherings, help people better dispose of garbage by
					directing waste to the correct bin. They have a key social aspect
					and spark conversations for attracting other people to their organization.
					However their presence could also have a social limitation such as
					embarrassment or humiliation for not knowing a perceived simple task.<br> <br>
					2. Appropriate social groups are commonly used for incorporating activity.
					Social relationships like family or friends can be used to gamify
					activities, share information, and encourage persistent action.
					These relationships are also especially critical because of the
					physicality of waste disposal as opposed to shallow clicktivism.<br> <br>
					3. The institutional  level of recycling is not very well known and
					easy to understand. I personally knew very little about the
					iconography commonly associated and attempted to explore ideas
					to make them more comprehensive. <br> <br>
					4. The last grouping highlighted differences
					in waste processes according to the function. Is
					there a standardized way of generating and disposing
					waste? How could similarities as well as sensitivities
					attributed to concepts of cooking, arts and crafts, and
					 cleaning be levied in a new system. An understanding was
					 developed that waste is a byproduct and end result of each process.
					 However, in order to address unsustainability, recommendations
					 should be heard at the beginning of the process.
