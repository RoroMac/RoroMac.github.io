				<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
				</div>

				<div id = "introback">
				<p>The prompt for the class was to find a topic we are passionate about which
					relates to the broad scope of health. We chose to pair environmentally
					conscious efforts with digital activism in the exigence of COVID-19 which
					has forcibly moved a number of activist movements to online platforms.

				<p>We wanted to explore how to make change more accessible for
					all users. We held initial biases that current digital, environmental
					activism teetered on either sides of an extreme gradient; shallow
					(clicktivism) to demanding a high degree of political participation which often has monetary,
					time-based, and social constraints. We spent ten weeks following the human-centered methodology
					taught in HCDE 518, which led us through preliminary research, interviews, personas,
					sketching and ideation, prototyping, and gathering-feedback.</p>

				<p>Our prototype can be accessed through the following image and
					the submitted and the comprehensive design solution can be found through
					this <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J843YeTDLpgoRCv_s8VQwkB1NJv_XRPh/view?usp=sharing"> google drive hyperlink (40 pages)</a>.

				<p class = "title"> Preliminary research</p>

				<div id="showcase">

					<p id="presearchstxt">Preliminary research consisted of using IDEO’s design exploration cards;
						Learn, Look, Ask, and Try to identify current barriers to waste disposal
						and understand what alternatives are available for people to use.</p>

						<p class="subsub">Five Why's</p>

						<p>Methodology &colon; <br>
						An informal interview process taken place with a friend over a
						thirty minute period. After the initial "Do you recycle" question,
						every answer was responded with a "why?".
						</p>

						<p>Findings &colon; <br>
							1. Doesn't produce that much waste. <br>
							2. Small home-scale recycling efforts don't help <br>
							3. Not comparable to the amount of waste produced by large companies <br>
							4. Difficult to find adequate support for recycling. <br>
							5. There should be greater incentive and ease to use the recycling system.
						</p>

					<p class="subsub"> Affinity Diagram</p>

					<p>Methodology &colon; <br>
					Draw a map of the relationships at interplay surrounding the topic.
					While this method can reinforce personal biases, it makes the participant
					aware of what they currently know, what information is missing, and the
					regions  available for intervention. The associations started as broad groupings and then
					divulged into more hypserspecific and useful suggestions.</p>

					<p>Findings &colon; <br>
					1. Waste disposal aids, commonly known at festivals or other
					public gatherings, help people better dispose of garbage by
					directing waste to the correct bin. They have a key social aspect
					and spark conversations for attracting other people to their organization.
					However their presence could also have a social limitation such as
					embarrassment or humiliation for not knowing a perceived simple task.<br> <br>
					2. Appropriate social groups are commonly used for incorporating activity.
					Social relationships like family or friends can be used to gamify
					activities, share information, and encourage persistent action.
					These relationships are also especially critical because of the
					physicality of waste disposal as opposed to shallow clicktivism.<br> <br>
					3. The institutional  level of recycling is not very well known and
					easy to understand. I personally knew very little about the
					iconography commonly associated and attempted to explore ideas
					to make them more comprehensive. <br> <br>
					4. The last grouping highlighted differences
					in waste processes according to the function. Is
					there a standardized way of generating and disposing
					waste? How could similarities as well as sensitivities
					attributed to concepts of cooking, arts and crafts, and
					 cleaning be levied in a new system. An understanding was
					 developed that waste is a byproduct and end result of each process.
					 However, in order to address unsustainability, recommendations
					 should be heard at the beginning of the process.

			<p class="title">USER RESEARCH</p>
			<div class="right">
				<p>Methodology:<br>
					The two interviews that I conducted were all
					greater than an hour and because of the open-ended
					design question we had no specific demographic in mind.
					Because of the difficulties of talking to strangers during this time,
					my interviewees were both acquaintances that I knew prior. This sample
					size could have skewed results as they shared common characteristics of
					being similar in age, sharing the same gender, and having common cultural
					backgrounds. However, due to the distinct differences in discussed topics
					and their perceived behavioral patterns I would believe the potential change
					to be inconsequential.<br><br>

					The interview structure was a combination of scripted and
					unscripted questions. The questions discussed general lifestyle habits,
					such as what digital applications they currently used or what they look
					for while shopping. The interview would then progress into more topic-focused
					questions like the ease or stories associated with waste disposal processes.
					Because I wanted to see if they naturally considered waste in their daily
					rituals, I tried to give them as vague of an introduction as possible.<br><br>

					Findings:<br>
					- Typically don’t go searching for the information,
					but once they learn that something highly relevant like a
					toxic warning or company-ethics, they’ll usually attempt to go
					with more inconvenient but sustainable option<br>
					- One story talked about how they kept reusing a plastic
					water bottle even at parties to impress their friends
					- Both interviewees felt that waste conversations are highly
					dependent on the local community and one noted how waste seems
					to only be a relevant conversation the younger you are.<br>
					- Endorsements and appearance of officiality are important to
					help make information reliable especially when there are so many
					different variations of information on the same subject. <br>
					- One discussed the perceived physicality of information,
					having discussions and tangible mechanisms make it harder for
					the topic of waste management to be ignored. <br><br>
