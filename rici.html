				<p>The prompt for the class was to find a topic we were passionate about,
					relating to the broad scope of health. We chose to pair environmentally
					conscious efforts with digital activism in the exigence of COVID-19 due
					to responses that have forcibly moved a number of
					activist movements to online platforms. </p>

				<p>However, the key idea that we wanted to address was how to access this
					activism for all users. We held initial biases that current environmental
					activism teetered on either sides of an extreme gradient; a little shallow
					(clicktivism) to demanding a high degree of political participation which often has monetary,
					time-based, and social constraints. We spent 8 weeks following the human-centered methodology
					taught in the HCDE 518 course which led us through preliminary research, interviews, personas,
					sketching and ideation, prototyping, and gathering-feedback. </p>

				<p>Our prototype can be accessed through the image on the right and
					the submitted and comprehensive design solution can be found through
					this <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J843YeTDLpgoRCv_s8VQwkB1NJv_XRPh/view?usp=sharing"> google drive hyperlink (40 pages) </a>.
					While we all shared roles in the
					ideation and research process, the final design was broken up into three
					sections and three corresponding tasks; My Rici, Analyze, and Community tabs.
					I personally worked on the final design and previous iterations of the Community section.
					For  questions and interests pertaining to other sections not mentioned on this page,
					feel free to see the design solution or send me an email.</p>
